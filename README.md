- Integrated the app with the **Back-End API** using **Axios**, with URLs stored securely in `.env`.  
- Implemented **Routing** using **React Router**.  
- Managed **data fetching and caching** with **TanStack Query**.  
- Developed **Forms with Validation** using **React Hook Form**.  
- Used **React Icons** for interactive and visually appealing components.  
- Created a **custom hook** called `useAuth` to handle **Authentication** logic (login state, token handling, and user session).

### 🧩 Custom Hook: `useAuth`

It manages login state, retrieves session info, and provides easy access to authentication logic throughout components.  
This hook also powers **route protection**, redirecting unauthorized users when needed.
